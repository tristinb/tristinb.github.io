			"content_html": "<p>Pollsters and journalists often present polling results as being correct to within a plus or minus three percentage points, with 95 percent confidence. However, we often see election results fall outside this three percentage point error. In the 2020 election, for example, polls missed by an average of <a href=\"https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Task-Force-on-2020-Pre-Election-Polling_Executive-Summary.pdf\">4.5 percentage points at the national level</a>. This post explores where this additional polling error comes from and how we should interpret polls in light of this additional error. Since polls are surveys of respondents' vote preferences, I use the words polls and surveys synonymously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-3-percent-margin-of-error-comes-from-sampling-error\" tabindex=\"-1\">The 3 percent margin of error comes from sampling error <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If we assume a three percent margin of error and we see a poll that says 54 percent of the respondents prefer Hans to Franz then we can be 95 percent confident that the true proportion of the population as a whole that prefers Hans lies somewhere between 51 and 57 percent. The &quot;95 percent confident&quot; means that if we ran our poll a million times, we would only see a result less than 51 percent or greater than 57 in only 5 percent of these polls.</p>\n<p>The following bit of python code simulates this process. The code assumes you ask 1,000 people if they prefer Hans or Franz. If they prefer Hans, record a 1. Otherwise, record 0. We assume the true proportion of the population that prefers Hans a is 54 percent. This is one poll. We can now run this 10 thousand times and see how often the polls find support as either less than 51 percent or greater than 57 percent.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> numpy <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> np\npopulation_pct<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">.54</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># True value of the population</span>\npoll_sample_size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1000</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># poll 1000 people</span>\ntest_draws <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> np<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>random<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>binomial<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>poll_sample_size<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> pop_pct<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> size<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">10_000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>poll_sample_size <span class=\"token comment\"># sample from a binomial distribution; divide by n since we want a proportion</span></code></pre>\n<p>The plot below compares each of the 10 thousand samples from this distribution to what we would expect in theory.

We see 5.7 percent, rather than 5 percent, of the estimate fell outside of 3 percent because the estimate's standard error, depends on both the number of people you poll (n) and the true proportion of the population that supports candidate A.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> But a sample size of 1000 generally gets close to 3 percent margins at 95 percent confidence.</p>\n<p>The three percentage point error above occurs because we only take a sample of 1,000 from the population rather than measuring the whole thing. Randomness in who is sampled leads to deviations from the population's true value. However, sources other than sampling error generally cause polls and surveys to be off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bias-who-answers-polls\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bias: Who Answers Polls? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In addition to sampling error, any error in a poll can be decomposed to two factors: bias and variance. Bias is how systematically wrong polls tend to be in a certain direction. For example, when polls all tend to overestimate their support for Franz, they are biased. Variance is the error in excess of the sampling error described above, but is not associated with any particular direction -- it can be either to favorable or too unfavorable to Franz. Typically, tools to reduce bias increase variance and vice-versa, this is the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff\">bias-variance tradeoff</a>.</p>\n<p>A poll will be biased if one candidate's supporters are systematically less likely to respond to a pollster than their competitor's supporters. Conversely, sometimes a candidate's supporters may over-respond to polls relative to others. For example, they could be particularly excited about their candidate, or be eager to voice their displeasure at a scandal.</p>\n<p>The simulation below shows what happens when one side's supporters are systematically less likely to respond to the pollster. We can then look at a simple method to adjust this bias assuming we have estimates on what group is under-responding.</p>\n<p>For the simulation, assume the population is split in half between two groups: group A and group B. Group A will support Hans with a 44 percent probability, while group B will support Hans with a 64 percent probability. If both groups were equally likely to respond, we would expect to see an average of 54 percent support for Hans. However, let's assume group B will only respond to the pollster with a 25 percent probability; while everybody in group A responds to the pollster. In the simulation below, the pollster just needs to sample 1000 people. The pollster doesn't necessarily know what group each respondent belongs to, even though we will collect the groups in the code.</p>\n<p>The code below simulates one pollster collecting this data.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\">a_vote_prob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">.44</span>\nb_vote_prob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">.64</span>\nb_response_prob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">.25</span>\nresults <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\ngroup <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\npoll_sample_size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1000</span>\ni <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>poll_sample_size<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    a_vote <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> stats<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>bernoulli<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a_vote_prob<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>rvs<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    results<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>append<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a_vote<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    group<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>append<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'a'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    i<span class=\"token operator\">+=</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">==</span>poll_sample_size<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">break</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> stats<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>uniform<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>rvs<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span>b_response_prob<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        b_vote <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> stats<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>bernoulli<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b_vote_prob<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>rvs<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        results<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>append<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b_vote<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        group<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>append<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        i<span class=\"token operator\">+=</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span></code></pre>\n<p>The code above only simulates one poll.

The average amount of support across all 10 thousand polls is 47 percent, rather than the true level of 54 percent. You can also notice very little overlap between the true distribution and the polls. If we run code to see how many of our samples are within three percent of the true value, we get the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\">Proportion outside 3 percent:  0.9976</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, only 24 out of the 10 thousand polls were within 3 percentage points of the true value. This would occur despite sampling error alone suggesting that 950 should have fallen within 3 percentage points of the true value. If we assumed a 3 percent margin of error, we could be fairly confident Franz would win.</p>\n<p>From this example, we can see that substantial bias can result when one segment of the population does not respond to the poll and this segment also has different views than those more likely to respond. Fortunately, we can adjust for this bias, at least when we know who is under-responding.</p>\n<h3 id=\"correcting-bias-adding-variance\" tabindex=\"-1\">Correcting Bias, Adding Variance <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The code above also included weights. Let's assume that the pollster knew the true distribution of groups A and B in the population, which we defined as 50/50. Let's also assume that the only factor that impacts how likely someone is to respond to the poll is what group they are in.</p>\n<p>Although many techniques exist to correct for bias when you have group-level characteristics, we can use a simple one here: inverse probability weighting (IPW). Essentially, IPM increases the weight for each response for the group that was under-sampled and decreases the weight for each response in the group that was over-sampled.</p>\n<p>The figure below shows the results we get if we adjust the biased draws above with IPW.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://tristinb.github.io/img/dIXo2WUPri-640.avif 640w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://tristinb.github.io/img/dIXo2WUPri-640.webp 640w\"><img alt=\"Biased draws corrected with IPW\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tristinb.github.io/img/dIXo2WUPri-640.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></picture></p>\n<p>Although this distribution is centered close to the true value of 54 percent, notice that the samples are &quot;wider&quot; than the theoretical distribution. This means that each poll is noisier than expected. We can run code similar to the above to find what proportion falls outside +/- 3 percentage point from the correct value of .54:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\">Proportion outside 3 percent:  0.1964</code></pre>\n<p>After this bias correction, we now have nearly 20 percent of each pall falling outside of +/- 3 percentage point from the true value -- substantially more than the five percent we would expect from sampling error alone.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, pollster's efforts to adjust for bias often results in more variance. Because you may add substantial weight to a small number of respondents, the makeup of these particular respondents can cause poll results to fluctuate wildly. A notable example occured in 2016, when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">one person was weighted around 30 times as much as the average respondent</a>. When this person was out of the sample Clinton led; when he was included Clinton trailed. This poll wasn't necessarily systematically pro or anti Clinton, but the inclusion of this one additional respondent made the poll's expected level of Clinton support to vary far beyond what sampling error alone would have us believe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-this-compare-to-real-life\" tabindex=\"-1\">How Does This Compare to Real Life? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A 2018 paper by Shirani-Mehr et al <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> analyzed US gubernatorial, senatorial, and presidential election polls in the final three weeks of the campaign between 1998 and 2014 with the goal of disentangling the amount of bias, and variance, in the polls. They find that, on average, bias is about 2 percentage points. These biases aren't systematically pro or against either party but fluctuate at random -- if there was a correlation with political party, it could be adjusted for.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the paper finds that variance is about 1.5 percentage points more than we would expect from sampling error alone. The authors speculate this is due to the methods pollsters use to account for bias. Taken together, the additional bias and variance suggests that rather than assuming polls are accurate to within +/- 3 percentage points, we should really assume they are accurate to within +/- 6 to 7 percentage points.</p>\n<!-- Going back to the 2020 election, which was according to the American Association for Public Opinion Research, [the biggest polling miss since 1980](https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Task-Force-on-2020-Pre-Election-Polling_Executive-Summary.pdf). Pollster's missed despite incorporating what they assumed biased their polls in 2016. The report finds that average error was about 4.5 percent at the national level, and 5.1 percent at the state level, both within the 6-7 point margin discussed above. -->\n<h3 id=\"where-do-we-go\" tabindex=\"-1\">Where do We Go? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://tristinb.github.io/blog/polls/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The 3 percent margin of error often reported with a poll refers to sampling error alone. But many other factors combine to make this error substantially larger.</p>\n<p>If non-response is correlated to a specific outcome, the poll will be biased away from the preferences of the group that fails to respond. If pollsters can measure the characteristic behind who doesn't respond -- if a certain demographic is less likely to respond -- they can adjust the results, even if it risks adding more variance. However, more generally pollsters cannot measure the characteristic behind non-response, leaving the poll biased. In elections, Shirani-Mehr et al.'s paper shows that bias lurks across all polls in roughly every election.</p>\n<p>Given the declining response to surveys, many firms have resorted to using panels. Many of them, such as YouGov use a mix of panels and probabilistic sampling through methods such as random digit dialing to get their sample. However, one notable issue with panels is that they have a notorious high rate of attrition -- people take one or two surveys and then never respond again. The, hopefully by now obvious, problem arises when those who choose to stay on panels are systematically different from the population with respect to the questions they are asked. For instance, people who like answering survey questions may also like Biden, but we have no measure of &quot;affinity for answering surveys&quot;, so we cannot easily make an adjustment for this bias.</p>\n<p>Overall, we should 1) assume the margin of error is much larger than the 3 percent. Three percent doesn't even make sense in theory, since it only relies on sampling error, when we know other types of error occur. 2) Think deeply about who decides to respond to a poll.</p>\n<p>A recent poll following Israel's invasion of Gaza showed a surprisingly large number of Gen-Z respondents believed Hamas' murder of civilians was justified. This poll was taken as protests broke out across the country against Israel's invasion. During the 2020 protests, protestors were systematically <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/06/24/recent-protest-attendees-are-more-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-younger-than-americans-overall/\">younger than Americans as a whole</a>. If these trends continued, the protests against Israel likely skewed Gen-Z. Protesting may also fires these activists up for their cause, making them more likely to respond to a pollster. If these protestors are also more likely to agree with more extreme statements -- perhaps just being caught in the moment -- then the amount of support for Hamas' use of violence would be drastically inflated. We can try to look toward other indicators to determine how plausible this explanation is.

Banks are fighting the crypto industry over whether to allow paying interest for holding stablecoins. The bankers argue that paying interest on stablecoins will drive consumers away from bank deposits. Fewer deposits will leave the banks with less to lend out to consumers, reducing the credit available for homes, cars, trinkets and businesses. However, deposits simply represent a cheap source of funding for bank lending. If banks see good opportunities, they often draw on money market funding. When they don't see good opportunities, such as after the 2008 financial crisis, they won't extend credit, independent of their deposit level. Although interest on stablecoins may drive money out of the traditional banking system, banks can increase the interest rates they pay on savings or seek money from money markets to extend credit they find attractive.

This argument deals with two theories about the relationship between credit and money creation, which goes back to at least the 1930s. The banks argue money drives credit, with banks creating money as part of their role as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. The typical story begins with the government setting a reserve ratio of something like 10 percent. It then follows a person, often named Alice who deposits $100 into a bank. The bank then lends 90 percent of this (keeping their 10 percent reserves) to someone named Bob, who then deposits their $90 at a new bank, which then lends $81. The process continues until the banking system is out of funds to lend. This results in $1000 of new money being created.[^money_multiplier]. In this view, the reserve ratio and the initial deposit size drive the total amount of credit created.

Although this story is still taught in introductory macroeconomics courses, the reserve requirement has little relationship with a bank's lending decision. Following the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed flooded the system with reserves via quantitative easing (QE). Yet lending remained sluggish. In March 2020, the Fed formally eliminated the reserve requirement completely. Despite no reserve requirement, banks simply wouldn't lend because they couldn't find borrowers attractive enough to overcome their risk aversion.

Following this experience, many Central Banks, such as the Bank of England, point out that the story works in reverse: banks first make a loan then credit the borrower's account via a deposit. In other words loans drive an increase in deposits. The issue, then, is how banks get funding to make these loans.

Deposits are a cheap, stable, source of funding for these loans. When banks have sufficient supply 

Because deposits are typically for convenience, depositors don't respond strongly to interest rate changes. This allowed banks to pay little interest on savings despite the Fed raising interest rates in 2022. But on the other hand, banks can struggle to pull in more deposits to fund loans they find attractive. To fund these opportunities without loans, banks commonly turn to money markets to fund loans.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, with banks seeing more opportunity to lend than they had deposits available, they moved to the money markets.

[^money_multiplier]: The formula for the money multiplier is the initial deposit divided by the required reserve ratio.

## Notes

The argument is about funding. The theory the banks are positing doesn't hold, but deposits represent a cheap source of funding for them, that's what they want to keep. Will it reduce total credit in the economy? Unclear, they are typically constrained by good opportunities (see the financial crisis). When they have good opportunities, they have a long history of going to money markets.

Deposits are a cheap source of funding. But if the cost of funding increases for banks, especially the regional banks, what does that do to their bottom lines or margins? Can that reduce total credit?

Deposit beta: banks can pay a higher rate on deposits to keep using them for funding. or they can go to money markets, as they have done in the past. High deposit betas calculated by the Fed suggest that supply of deposits is high enough for the banks.

If we care about the money multiplier, the total amount of money equals initial deposit/reserve ratio. So if initial deposits are $100 and RR is 10 percent, we have $1000 total money.

Big question: Are stablecoins shadow currencies/banks?
Need to answer 1) What is a shadowbank 2) do cryptocurrencies fall into this

Gorton and Zhang point out that Wyoming's Special Purpose Depository Institutions are letting stablecoins effectively become banks. 
 
Slippage

Stable coins are mostly used to move in and out of the crytpo ecosystem

Instant payments already exist in europe, so it isn't clear what the utility of stablecoins are, except for underground things

We have private credit and shadow banking that provide loans. Maybe this is the angle.

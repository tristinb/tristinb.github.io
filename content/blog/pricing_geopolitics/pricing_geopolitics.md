Geopolitical shocks typically have little lasting effects on US stocks. Research by [JP Morgan](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/nam/en/insights/markets-and-investing/how-do-geopolitical-shocks-impact-markets) studied 36 events, beginning with Germany's invasion of France and ending with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and found that the six month return after the shock was indistinguishable from the return over any random six-month that didn't cover a shock. Intuitively, geopolitics should play a substantial role in stock prices, but research consistently shows that they rarely do. Basic financial modeling, however, shows why this is the case and what to look for the next time a global event causes the financial press to fret.

Economists and investors from Irving Fisher to Benjamin Graham and his prot√©ge Warren Buffett have long argued that a company's cash flows over the long-run determine a stock's intrinsic value. Cash flows are fundamental because they can be reinvested into the company to fuel growth or paid back to an investor via dividends or stock buybacks.[^cost_of_capital] The goal in this valuation approach is to buy companies priced below their intrinsic valuation and sell those that overpriced. Although stocks may fluctuate for various reasons in the short-term, value investors argue that cash flows over the long run are what truly drives returns.

Since investors care about cash flows in the long run, prices should reflect the market's best guess about these future cash flows. An event that leads investors to revise this guess should impact the stock's price. Michael Mauboussin and Alfred Rappaport emphasize three fundamental drivers of a company's valuation where shifts can impact a stock's price by changing the market's expectation of future cash flows: 1) sales growth 2) operating margins and 3) incremental investment.[^expectations_investing] These three channels should provide insight into a geopolitical shock's impact on equities.[^threshold_to_sell]

According to [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-tariffs-are-forecast-to-affect-us-stocks) about 28 percent of the revenues for S&P 500 companies come from abroad. But large US companies in the S&P 500 are globally diversified, which results in them having a small amount of revenue, if any, in countries where crises tend to break out. Therefore, due to diversification, unless a shock is regional or global, it may not impact sales growth over a sufficiently long time horizon to change investors' expectations. Therefore, when considering a shock's impact on a company's sales, we would need to find a shock hitting, and reducing demand in, a vital export market. This is unlikely for large, diversified companies.

Although large companies have diversified sales, they may have concentrated supply chains where shocks can negatively impact both operating margins and incremental investment. Operating margins relate to the costs of doing business in the short term, meaning it excludes things like financing and long-term investments. If input prices increase, operating margins will fall. This hit may be substantial. The 1970s oil shock was the one event in the Morgan Stanley report that had lasting impacts on equity prices as high oil prices increased costs across the economy.

But not all shocks drive up prices, in part because of the dollar's role in the international financial system. Typically, crises lead investors to invest in safe assets, and US government bonds are considered the safest. This "flight to safety" can strengthen the dollar, thereby making imports cheaper. Since most imports to the US are used as intermediate goods (cite), a decrease in import prices should improve operating margins, all else equal. Although many commodities are priced in dollars, and a stronger dollar can make a company's exports relatively less competitive expensive, for many large firms, a stronger dollar can substantially decrease operating expenses.

Some firms may own, or be significant investors in, factories abroad. If a shock hits these factories, these firms may need to diversify. Although being forced to make new investments in property, plants, and equipment may be an inefficient use of capital, a diversified supply chain provides resilience to future shocks, thereby reducing the uncertainty of future cash flows, which increases their present value. For long-term focused investors, this diversification may be a net positive, cancelling out the negative short-term impact on the stock price.

Taken together, we can see a complicated relationship between these fundamental value drivers and geopolitical shocks. The next section briefly shows these drivers at play after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

McDonald's was one of the most exposed companies to the Russo-Ukraine war, with nearly [9 percent of its revenues](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/Russia%20and%20Ukraine%20Supplemental%20Schedule.pdf) coming from the two countries. But as the following table shows, its stock outperformed the S&P 500 (measured by the SPY index) throughout the year following Russia's invasion. 

| Date       | SPY Close | MCD Close | SPY Pct. Change | MCD Pct. Change |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2022-02-24 | 407.46    | 226.22    | -               | -               |
| 2022-05-25 | 379.21    | 226.53    | -6.93           | 0.14            |
| 2022-08-23 | 395.21    | 243.21    | -3.01           | 7.51            |
| 2022-11-21 | 379.74    | 257.67    | -6.80           | 13.90           |
| 2023-02-24 | 383.21    | 248.89    | -5.95           | 10.02           |

If we took the geopolitical shock and potential revenue loss at face value, we may have expected a significant drop in its stock price. Although 9 percent of revenue seems substantial, McDonald's owned and operated all of its restaurants in Ukraine and 84 percent of those in Russia, making this revenue expensive. Subtracting the cost of operating these restaurants caused this 9 percent of total revenue to equal less than 3 percent of its total operating income. And this exposure seems relatively small considering the broader macroeconomic environment. 

Post-pandemic inflation led to significant Fed tightening, with prominent economists [predicting a recession by the end of 2022](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-01/summers-says-risk-of-2022-recession-climbing-may-damp-inflation). As [the Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/07/mcdonalds-secret-sauce-plus-a-pickle-or-two) notes, McDonald's in the US is relatively insulated from inflation because it makes most of its revenue through franchise fees and a taking a fixed percent of total sales (not profits). Simultaneously, it is also a good bet in the event of a recession, as its low prices attract more price-conscious consumers. Therefore, considering the broad macroeconomic environment, investors may have liked McDonald's freeing up a substantial amount of capital by shutting their relatively low-return operations in Russia and Ukraine.

Despite our intuition and what we read about in the financial news, empirical studies consistently find minimal impact from geopolitical shocks. This post shows that these findings are consistent with valuation approaches to equities, as shocks are unlikely to cause large revisions in expectations of a stock's core value drivers. This is not to say geopolitics never matters, but when the next crisis occurs analyzing fundamental value drivers can help us better assess how much a shock will impact a stock.

## Footnotes

[^cost_of_capital]: But since these cash flows are only available in the future, and $100 today is worth more than $100 in a year, simply because you can invest the $100 in a treasury bill and get a positive return at almost zero risk, we need to discount these future cash flows by at least the cost of capital. This "discount rate" serves to translate the future value of cash flows to the present value.

[^expectations_investing]: Michael Mauboussin and Alfred Rappaport. 2020. Expectations Investing.

[^threshold_to_sell]: But keep in mind, the threshold to sell may be large, since investors may need a new opportunity to invest in, and many opportunities could be adversely impacted by the shock. Similarly, because selling a stock incurs tax liabilities any new opportunity must at least cover this loss.

[^domestic]: Of couse, if these firms are exporters a stronger dollar may then make their exports less competitive internationally.

## Notes

[JP Morgan](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/nam/en/insights/markets-and-investing/how-do-geopolitical-shocks-impact-markets) 
    - Geopolitical shocks usually have no impact on large cap equity returns, but they can impact local small cap equities, i.e. small cap Taiwanese companies, German manufacturers after Russia invaded Ukraine (but large cap companies did ok since they are globally diversified)
    - Look at 3, 6, 12 months after an event and compare it with average 3, 6, 12 month periods without an event. 3 months after an event leads to a downturn, on average, but nothing stands out 6 and 12 months after the event begins (i.e. an invasion)
      - But the 1973 oil shock stands out, it did have an impact for at least a year


The 1970s oil shock led stocks to drop because companies depended on oil to run their businesses. Margins collapsed as prices rose, leading to less profit across the board. This oil shock was the only one in JP Morgan's sample that had lasting impacts on stock prices.

I also wonder if the S&P 500 isn't a bad metric. For example, do people just move their portfolio around to stocks that will benefit from the stock? Certain companies are likely to benefit, while others lose. If you are picking a stock

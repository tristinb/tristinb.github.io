# About

I'm Tristin. I've spent over a decade using data to solve difficult real-world problems in both academia and industry. Currently, I'm building [Daggy](https://www.daggydata.com), which integrates directly into AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT to enable sophisticated data analytics through natural conversation.

Most recently I was an applied scientist at [Pendulum Intelligence](https://pendulumintel.com/), where I built and deployed several NLP/ML models while working with stakeholders ranging from sales to product to demonstrate value and close deals. Before that, I was a data scientist at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) where I built several machine learning models and executive-facing dashboards to help navigate pre-IPO highs and COVID pandemic lows.

Before industry, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and completed an MA in economics and PhD in political science with a focus on quantitative methods from UC Santa Barbara.

# About

I'm Tristin. For the past 10+ years, I've been solving problems with math and data.

Most recently at [Pendulum Intelligence](https://pendulumintel.com/), where I joined as the 6th employee, I built and deployed several NLP/ML models (including one within a month of its arXiv publication) while working with stakeholders ranging from sales to product to show value and close deals. Before that, I worked on price recommendation and revenue forecasting at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) from pre-IPO through the COVID pandemic.

Before working as a data/applied scientist, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and completed a PhD in political science with a focus on quantitative methods in the social sciences from UC Santa Barbara, where I also earned my Masters in economics.
